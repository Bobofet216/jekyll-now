<table>
  <tr>
    <td>OUTCOME: </td>
    <td>We Decoded our messages that we made using Vlookup and concatenated them making it so everything comes full circle so our system can encode then decode then combine the messages. Near the end we moved on to creating a large scale encryption machine so we have a a code for every line of the Alphabet.                                                                  </td>
