    <td>OUTCOME: </td>
    <td>In the lesson we had to type out some specific code and then use the pictures in the Fuze book to arrange the lights, cables and resistors properly and then enter the code to get a result and later in the lesson add more light, cables etcâ€¦ We typed out the code with no real problem but we needed a little help when it came plugging in all the electronics. We did  start to add more at the end but we ran of time.</td>
