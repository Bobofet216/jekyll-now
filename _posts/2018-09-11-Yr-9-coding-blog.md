    <td>OUTCOME: </td>
    <td>In Computer science lesson 1, we learned about encoding messages in google slides. But first we learned about some of the earliest examples of message encoding mainly how Caesar would encrypted his war commands so if they were intercepted the enemy wouldn't know how to read it and the message would be worthless to them. We were using a code: =VLOOKUP((row and number),$A:$B,2,false) so whatever you type the letters would be changed to whatever you set them to on rows A and B.                                                                   </td>
  </tr>
