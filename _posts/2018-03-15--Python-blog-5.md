    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We were writing code that would calculate the money that a paperboy would earn in a week's work depending on different variables. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Get this piece of code working and possibly moving on to making mine own variations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td> Yes I did.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Making sure to check each line of code typed for spelling errors, missing symbols like brackets etc. This ended up working quite well as most of the time it worked first time with no need for going back and checking for small mistakes that could have been made.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Occasionally I might have got a bit carried away in changing part of the code to be specially funny and not relevant to the task at hand or just taking to the person next to me on a unrelated subject to the code. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Try and focus on the task at hand, not trying to be funny with it, no talking to the person next to me (Unless it related to the current subject we are working on).</td>
  </tr>
